## Introduction

Sometimes a test will require private user data or information that shouldn't be publicly available (like credit card numbers or user passwords). This tool ecrypts private information to an encrypted cloud instance of a MongoDB database. And then provides the means to decrypt that same data for use in a test case. All for the sake of security.
